                Civilization in the Bengal delta dates back more than 4,300 years. The borders of present-day Bangladesh
                were established during the British partition of Bengal and India in 1947, when the region became East
                Pakistan, part of the newly formed state of Pakistan. It was separated from West Pakistan by 1,600 km
                (994 mi) of Indian territory. Due to a desire for political, economic and linguistic self-determination,
                popular agitation and civil disobedience grew against the Pakistani state. This culminated in the
                Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971.

                The Peopleâ€™s Republic of Bangladesh was founded as a constitutional, secular, democratic, multiparty,
                parliamentary republic. After independence, Bangladesh went through periods of poverty and famine, as
                well as political turmoil and military coups. The restoration of democracy in 1991 has been followed by
                considerable advances in economic, political, and social development.
